We plan on building a **Subscription Management Service** that leverages the power and efficiences of __Open Banking Infrastructure__ which will enable us to stop paying ridiculous charges to
Payment Processors like Stripe, WindCave, etc.

Our motiviation is born from operating [Logmate](https://logmate.co.nz) and the frustrations we have experienced first hand.
